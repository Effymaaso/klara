/**
 * @fileoverview Authentication Service
 *
 * This service will handle all authentication-related logic, such as user registration,
 * login, logout, password resets, and session management. It will interface with the
 * user service to create and retrieve user data upon successful authentication.
 *
 * Functions to implement:
 * - signUp(email, password, firstName, lastName): Creates a new user account.
 * - logIn(email, password): Authenticates a user and returns a session token.
 * - logOut(): Destroys the user's session.
 * - sendPasswordResetEmail(email): Initiates a password reset process.
 * - verifyPasswordResetToken(token, newPassword): Verifies the reset token and updates the password.
 */

// Placeholder for future implementation.
